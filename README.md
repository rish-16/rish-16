## Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rishabh, a CS + Math kid & Machine Learning research student from the National University of Singapore (NUS)! I am interested in Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Biology and Cheminformatics, and am advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io). 

I love open-sourcing, writing, talking tech, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar.

I am currently a research student at I2R, ASTAR with [Dr. Li Xiaoli](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/) working on Graph Representation Learning for the Open Catalyst Project
