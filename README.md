## Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rishabh, a CS + Math kid & Machine Learning research student from the National University of Singapore (NUS)! I am interested in Geometric Deep Learning for Molecular Biology and Cheminformatics, and am advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io). 

I love open-sourcing, writing, talking tech, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar.

> I'm currently with [Prof. Pietro Lio's](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) group at the University of Cambridge looking at geometric graph representation learning and generative modelling for protein dynamics; co-supervised by Prof. Bryan Hooi.
