## Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rishabh, a CS + Math kid & Machine Learning research student from the National University of Singapore (NUS)! I am interested in **Geometric Deep Learning and Modelling for Structural Biology and Drug Discovery**, and am advised by [Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io). 

I love open-sourcing, writing, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar.

> I'm currently a Visiting Researcher in [Pietro Lio's](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) group at the University of Cambridge looking at geometric generative modelling for biomolecule design; co-advised by Bryan Hooi.
