## Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rishabh – a post-grad at Yale University co-advised by Rex Ying and Smita Krishnaswamy. I am interested in **Geometric Deep Learning and Modelling for Structural Biology and Drug Discovery**.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a CS and Pure Math degree. I was co-advised by Bryan Hooi (NUS) and Pietro Liò (Cambridge). My thesis was on **generative models for 3D RNA backbone design**.

I love open-sourcing, writing, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar.
