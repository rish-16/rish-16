## Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rishabh, a grad student at Yale University co-advised by Rex Ying. I focus on **geometric deep learning and generative modeling for drug discovery and molecular dynamics**.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) with a CS and Pure Math degree, and was co-advised by Bryan Hooi and Pietro Liò. My [thesis](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wOc1Yx5s09) was on **generative models for de novo 3D RNA backbone design**.

I spend my free time writing (tech/AI/philo/life), collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar 🤘🏻
