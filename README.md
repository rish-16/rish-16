# Sup Nerds üëãüèª

I'm Rishabh, a CS + Math kid & Machine Learning research student from the National University of Singapore (NUS)! I love open-sourcing, writing, talking tech, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar.

I study Graph Deep Learning, specifically graph representation learning and expressiveness. 

### Currently

- Studying Graph Attention with [Prof. Kimon Fountoulakis](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/about/people/kimon-fountoulakis) at the [OpAL Lab](http://opallab.ca), University of Waterloo
- Looking at Graph Representation Learning on molecules with [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) at NUS
- (Incoming) Research Student at I2R, ASTAR with [Dr. Li Xiaoli](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/xlli/) working on Graph Representation Learning for the Open Catalyst Challenge
