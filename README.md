### Sup Nerds 👋🏻

I'm Rish, a CS+Math kid & Machine Learning research student from the National University of Singapore (NUS)! I love talking tech, collecting laptop stickers, and playing the electric guitar. 

Currently, I'm looking at Graph Deep Learning and Semi-supervised Learning under [Prof. Bryan Hooi](http://bhooi.github.io) at NUS.
